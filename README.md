Day Scheduler Webpage



## Description

The Day Scheduler Webpage was created with the purpose of providing the user a tool to plan his/her workday. The Day Scheduler has a slot for each of the workday hours; the user can add notes on each of the text fields. By clicking on a Save button, the user can store the data on the browser's local storage and if the browser is closed, the user will be able to retrieve the saved data. The Day Scheduler also has a clock which lets the user know what time it is, and also it colors each of the hour slots depending on the current time. 

* Elapsed hour slots will colored gray.
* Current hour slot will be colored red.
* Future hour slots will be colored green.

By working on this project, I learned how to use the JQuery, moment.js and Bootstrap to create different content.
